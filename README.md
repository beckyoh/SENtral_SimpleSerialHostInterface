Original version of repository loaded from Mbed

SENtral Simple Serial Host interface for PNI Sensor Corp SENtral-A2 motion coprocessor. For use with the RM3100RTI Arduino shield module on top of an STM4 serial mbed board. Will work with an PNI RM3100RTI module or M&M motion modules. Interaction with unit using built in USB serial serial port set for 115200 baud. Send '?' char for menu. Presently requires SENtral firmware to either be loaded in the RM3100RTI Arduino shield SD Card or preloaded in the RM3100RTI or M&M module's EEPROM. Firmware is typically preloaded on the module's EEPROM by PNI. PNI Sensor Corp, 2016 www.pnicorp.com
